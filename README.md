# EPC_MODERATE

Analysis of EPC (Energy Performance Certificate) with the aim of identifying a model capable of synthesizing data and using it as training for machine/deep learning models for the prediction and/or identification of energy consumption patterns for the building stock. Currently, data from the Lombardy region are being analyzed.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **data**: folder with different EPC dataset already processed
- **models**: NN models and generative models
- **EPC_analysis**: generate NN models of EPC
- **synthetic_model**: generate synthetic model of EPC (filtred for labels A and A+)
- **utils**: functions to be used for the analysis
